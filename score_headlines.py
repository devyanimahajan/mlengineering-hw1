Create a program, called score_headlines.py
This program should accept an input text file which will contain one headline per line
This program should also accept a parameter describing the source of the headlines (example: chicagotribune, nyt)
If the client does not provide these two parameters, the program should give an appropriate and friendly error message
This program should output a new file, called headline_scores_source_year_month_day.txt (example: headline_scores_nyt_2025_01_15.txt)
